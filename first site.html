            <p>This R107-generation Mercedes-Benz 560 SL is a sleek and particularly well-presented example of the handsome modern classic roadster, which benefits from recent restorative maintenance. Presented with a timeless colour scheme, which complements the elegant styling, and a potent V8 engine coupled to a smooth-shifting automatic gearbox, it would make a stylish companion for weekend drives, fair-weather touring, and visits to car shows alike.   

                The description of this consignment is, to the best of the seller’s knowledge, accurate and not misleading. Collecting Cars requests a range of detail about the lot from the seller and performs a level of due diligence.

                Please note that it is not uncommon for classic or collectible vehicles to have received cosmetic repairs in the past, either to rectify damage or refresh appearance, and this work may be undetectable even upon visual inspection. Unless there is an explicit statement by the seller to the contrary, please assume that any vehicle could have had bodywork or paintwork during its life. Furthermore, photographs may not reflect the true colour or full condition of the vehicle. It is a bidder’s responsibility to satisfy themselves of the colour and condition of a vehicle, including its interior and the existence of any remedial bodywork or paintwork, before committing to bid or buy. <br>This includes by raising enquiries with the seller in the comments section.   
                
                For vehicles, unless otherwise stated, potential buyers should also assume that any cherished registration may be retained by the seller. Please see our Terms and Conditions for full details. </p>
